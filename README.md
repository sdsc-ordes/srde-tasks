# Task data:  Data Validation with SHACL
This repository contains 2 shacl-shapes graphs, and 2 sets of instance data. In each set, there is an instance that conforms to the shapes graph (Alice) and one that does not (Bob). The shapes graphs are different only in the way that a taco order is structured. One shapes graph validates "french" tacos, and another for "mexican" tacos.
